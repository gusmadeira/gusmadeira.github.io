    <h3>Origin and Dynamics of Satellites</h3>
This project is developed within the framework of the Group of Origin and Dynamics of Satellites (GODS), a research group focused on the physical mechanisms driving the formation, orbital evolution, and detectability of natural satellites, both in the Solar System and in extrasolar planetary systems.

    <h3>Evolution of the volatile content of the primordial Moon</h3>
In this project, I investigate the primordial inventory of volatile and refractory elements in the proto-Moon, as well as the satellite's orbital evolution driven by tidal and disk torques, and how these processes influenced its final composition. In particular, I focus on the mechanism of tidal-assisted hydrodynamic escape through hydrodynamical simulations, and how this process unfolded within the context of different models for lunar formation.

    <h3>Relationship Between the Moon’s Shape and Its Primordial Magma Ocean</h3>
This project focuses on the study of the magma ocean that likely covered the Moon shortly after its formation, and its relationship with the satellite’s orbital evolution. The Moon’s orbital evolution due to tidal forces is investigated while accounting for the presence of extensive magma layers on both the Earth and the Moon. The coupling between tidal dissipation and the thermal evolution of the magma ocean is analysed, along with the consequences of this process for the present-day shape of the Moon.

    <h3>Origin of Saturn’s Satellites from Ancient Rings</h3>
In this project, I investigate the hypothesis that Saturn's satellites formed via accretion from an ancient ring system, through hydrodynamical simulations. The study explores different tidal evolution models for the satellites, including migration effects induced by the planet’s gaseous envelope. The work also examines how the ring system itself evolved into the main rings observed around Saturn today.

    <h3>Dynamics Around Asymmetric Bodies</h3>
This project investigates the dynamics around irregularly shaped bodies through N-body numerical simulations, stability maps, and chaos indicators. Unlike larger bodies, which tend to be nearly spherical with symmetric distortions, smaller bodies often exhibit more pronounced asymmetries, capable of generating chaotic zones due to eccentricity diffusion and the overlap of spin–orbit resonances. The study analyses how orbital stability behaves in the presence of central bodies with varying degrees of asymmetry, as well as under the influence of additional gravitational fields and external perturbative forces.
